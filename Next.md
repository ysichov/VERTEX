What is not done yet, in the order it is likely to be picked up. The work that landed is in
[history.md](history.md); how it was built, stage by stage, is in [dev_history.md](dev_history.md).

- Authorization on the ABAP side. The table resource lets any authenticated user read any
  transparent table; `S_TABU_DIS` / `S_TABU_NAM` are not checked anywhere yet. `SE16N` resolves
  both through `VIEW_AUTHORITY_CHECK`, and a refusal has to be a real 403 rather than an empty
  result.
- Paging and a refresh button for the grid. Sorting a column sorts the rows that were read, which
  is what the SAP GUI grid does too; the row limit is still a constant in the page and the
  resource has no offset, so a large table stops at the first hundred rows.
- Conversion exits and F4. Values arrive as stored, so an `ALPHA`-padded key reads as padded.
- Filters on a joined table. The selection panel knows the base table's columns; the join's own
  are filterable by the resource already, and wait for the panel to learn their names.
- `ORDER BY` for the join, and editing an ON condition rather than taking what the dictionary
  proposes.
- The character-level highlight inside a changed line, and the pass that pairs a deletion with the
  insertion it belongs to. Both exist in AVE already, in the ABAP and in its browser port; see
  stage 12 of `dev_history.md` for why neither was copied wholesale.
- Blame.
- `C_ALLOW_SELF_REVIEW` in the review resource is on for testing and has to come out: AVE refuses
  to let a developer approve their own block, and so should this.
- Optimistic locking is one-sided. A write is refused when the review moved under the page, which
  is right, but AVE's own save still overwrites without looking.
- The metrics of a whole package, which needs the same treatment the transport just got.
- The DDIC side of a review. `TABD`, `DOMD` and `DTED` have no line diff, and their page in AVE is
  a field table kept as ready-made html; VERTEX says so rather than rendering it.
- The join as a graph in SelecTor, drawn as the page's own svg. The candidates already carry their
  direction and their parent, and the joined tables their ON condition, so the nodes and the edges
  are in the join resource's answer already and only the drawing is missing. Not mermaid, which
  ships here for Flow and Metrics: a node has to be clickable to take its table into the join, and
  a rendered picture is not. The view stays egocentric, the join so far in the middle and one step
  of candidates around it, because `DD08L` offers dozens of them around a table like `BKPF`.
